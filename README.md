Tracks your favorite Twitch streams and lets you know who's online and what games they're playing.

Twitch Tracker is an easy to use tool to keep track of your favorite streamers on twitch.tv. Simply add the stream name to your list and Twitch Tracker will let you know when they come online. Clicking their name will bring you to their stream if they're live, or to their past broadcasts if they're offline.
